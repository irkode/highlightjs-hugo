# highlightjs-hugo-text - Class reference

This class reference document is the same for the whole suite of Go and Hugo modules.

## Core modes used

- hljs.NUMBER_MODE
- hljs.QUOTE_STRING_MODE
- hljs.APOS_STRING_MODE
- hljs.COMMENT

## Default scopes (classes)

The following classes are used to style the output. Make sure your style has a definition for them.

- operator

  Used for the following items : `|`, `,`, `=`, `:=`

- property

  We style every dot word chain as property **except** if it starts with a _built_in_. In these cases we use _built_in_
  for the start (one or two words). see also _title.function.invoke_ below.

- punctuation

  Used for opening and closing parenthesis of sub expressions: `(`, `)`

- string

  Used for Names used in `block`, `define`, and `partial` actions.

- template-tag

  Used for opening and closing template tags. `{{` `{{-` `-}}` `}}`

- template-variable

  Used for template variables starting with a `$` (example `$myvar`)

- title.function.invoke (special)

  If a _built_in_ is followed by a _dot_ this must be an object. Knowing it's something special and it definitely calls
  something else we assign scope as _title.function.invoke_. Up-to-date themes may have a style configured. If not you can
  create your own or live with the fallback.

## New Scopes (Classes)

- template-variable.context

  The _Context_ -- a leading `.` or `$.` -- is a special thing in Go/Hugo templating so we use a dedicated class here. Use it in your CSS to create a different visual appearance for _Context_. keep in mind, that all styles out there do not define this one. So either add that for our own styles or take the fallback which is `template-variable` .

- string.raw

  A raw string in templates is a sequence of characters enclosed in backticks. All characters enclosed are taken
  literally.

## Keywords used

We use the following Scopes for keywords:

- literal

  `false`, `true` and `nil`

- keyword

  For Hugo as documented in [Hugo - go template functions](https://gohugo.io/functions/go-template/)
  except `urlquery`[^1]

  For Go as documented in [Go template actions](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#hdr-Actions) and `define`[^2]

- built_in

  For Hugo as documented in [Hugo - Functions](https://gohugo.io/functions/) excluding the keywords from above. We include both; the real _namespaced_ function name and aliases.

  For Go as documented in [Go Template-Text Predefined template functions](https://pkg.go.dev/text/)

## Submodes

_highlighjs-hugo-text_ uses the [Highlight.js][] builtin `xml` submode which uses some standard scopes.

Have a look at our [README](https://github.com/irkode/highlightjs-hugo-text/README.md) to see how to handle _text_ and _html_ templates differently.
